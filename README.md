# sub-goal-progress-bar
Code for a Streamelements widget that is configurable to track only certain sub events.

This is not a published Widget in the StreamElements' gallery so to use this go to the overlay you want to add this to.

Click on the blue button with the plus at the bottom left of the overlay display area.

Take the code from each of the files in this repository and replace the corresponding code under the headings as follows:

main.html goes into HTML
main.css goes into CSS
main.js goes into JS
main.json goes into FIELDS

Click the DONE button in the bottom right of the popup that you've been replacing code in.

Now under Settings the fields should be different. Update the defauls with the values you want and have fun!
