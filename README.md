Take the code from each of the files in this repository and replace the corresponding code under the headings as follows:

* widget.html goes into HTML
* widget.css goes into CSS
* widget.js goes into JS
* widget.json goes into FIELDS

Click the DONE button in the bottom right of the popup that you've been replacing code in.

Now under Settings the fields should be different. 

To change the progress of the goal bar expand 'Set Goal Progress' near the bottom of the section, enter a value, and click 'Set Progress'.
