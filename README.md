Take the code from each of the files in this repository and replace the corresponding code under the headings as follows:

widget.html goes into HTML
widget.css goes into CSS
widget.js goes into JS
widget.json goes into FIELDS

Click the DONE button in the bottom right of the popup that you've been replacing code in.

Now under Settings the fields should be different. Update the defauls with the values you want and have fun!
